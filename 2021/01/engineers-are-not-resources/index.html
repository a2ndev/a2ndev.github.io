				<div class="entry__content"><p>Engineers do not like to be called/treated as resources. How to treat them to get highly productive teams?</p>
<p>If you are in a Software Development project and you are part of Product/Marketing/Content or a team other than Product Development(PD), you might have noticed everyone talks about PD team members as <strong>resources</strong>. You tend to agree - because end of the day for whatever decisions you make - the bulk of the implementation may be done by PD team. And they are the work resources.</p>
<p>But, Engineers do not want to be called/known/treated as Resources. They like to own the product just like you &amp; want to contribute to Product decisions. In a way, this is good - then they may feel more accountable &amp; responsible for the Product they are building. Note that they are not being outsourced for implementing your dreams. They too are part of your dreams &amp; together you are building this product.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to make PD Team productive</p>
<ul>
<li>Include them in your thought process.</li>
<li>Listen to their ideas, thinking, concerns or other perspectives - treat them as early customer of the product.</li>
<li>You may agree/disagree with their thought process, but discussion is important.</li>
<li>Since, they contributed to early research/analysis &amp; design of the product - they feel more empowered</li>
<li>Everyone will align on the iterative style of pushing product to Customers from MVP to Delightful Product.</li>
<li>In fact, there are high chances that they innovate and present you something better than you were envisioning.</li>
<li>More importantly this whole practice will make you feel - they are not resources, but integral part of your team.</li>
</ul>
